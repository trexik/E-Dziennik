Goal of this project is to provide basic functionalities similar to librus and other grade-management web-services.
Current version supports additions of particular Class, Student to Class, Subject to Class.
Additional functionality - seperate web-page that is used to count final grade from (for now) preset percentages of StudentScore/MaxScore.
After we calcaulate grade we can set specific grade and subject that it refers to.
